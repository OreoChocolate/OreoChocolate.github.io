I am a Ph.D. candidate  in the <a href='https://cse.postech.ac.kr/'>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</a> department at POSTECH, working in the <a href='https://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/'>Computer Vision Lab</a>, advised by Prof. <a href='https://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/~mcho/'>Minsu Cho</a>.

My research focuses on computer vision and deep learning, including but not limited to human behavior understanding, scene understanding, domain adaptation, computational imaging, and its applications.
I am particularly interested in Human-Object Interaction (HOI) Detection, which goes beyond traditional object detection by not only localizing humans and objects but also recognizing their interactions. If you are interested in my research projects, please feel free to <a href="mailto:sanghyun.kim@postech.ac.kr">contact me</a>.
